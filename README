A 4chan thread downloader for the neckbeard weeaboo master race.

Features: 

  * Downloads a given thread to the target directory.

  * If the directory already contains some of those images, they are
  not re-downloaded.

  * Specify a minimum dimension size for the pictures

  * Specify how long you'd like the app to lurk the thread and keep
    downloading new pictures. When you do this, the directory you
    choose for the original download destination and other options are
    remembered.

  * Thanks to libcurl, its pretty speedy; when downloading a big
    thread we recycle our connection to the server so in theory we are
    playing nice. Some statistics are printed to stdout about how fast
    everything is being downloaded.

  * Some error checking. We won't write a file if there is a file with
    that name already. If you delete the target directory while
    lurking, or your disc fills up or you run out of quota, I don't
    know what will happen but you'll probably get a generic
    error. Good luck.
