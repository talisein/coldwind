A 4chan thread downloader for the neckbeard weeaboo master race.

Dependencies:

  * CMake (to build)
  * libcurl
  * libxml2
  * gtkmm3

Features: 

  * Downloads a given thread to the target directory. 

  ** Optionally save to a board and/or thread subdirectory.

  *** Easily specify the name of the subdirectory; auto-completion for
      existing folders is implemented.

  ** If the directory already contains some of those images, they are
     not re-downloaded.

  ** The progress meter is just about byte accurate.

  * Specify a minimum dimension size for the pictures

  * Specify how long you'd like the app to lurk the thread and keep
    downloading new pictures, or specify to lurk until the thread
    404s. When you do this, the directory you choose for the original
    download destination and other options are remembered.

  ** Uses the HTTP If-Modified-Since header, so while we're lurking we
     only use bandwidth if there is new content.

  * Thanks to libcurl, its pretty speedy; when downloading a big
    thread we recycle our connection to the server so in theory we are
    playing nice. 

  * Some statistics are printed to stdout about how fast everything is
    being downloaded; hopefully the bottleneck is moot.

  * Not completely unrobust. There's a lot of error checking in the
    code, but it hasn't been tested "in the wild" thoroughly.
