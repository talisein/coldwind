A 4chan thread downloader for the neckbeard weeaboo master race.

Features: 

  * Downloads a given thread to the target directory.

  * If the directory already contains some of those images, they are
  not re-downloaded.

  * Specify a minimum dimension size for the pictures

  * Specify how long you'd like the app to lurk the thread and keep
    downloading new pictures. When you do this, the directory you
    choose for the original download destination is remembered.

  * Little to no error checking. If you delete the target directory
    while lurking or your disc fills up or you run out of quota, I
    don't know what will happen. Good luck.
