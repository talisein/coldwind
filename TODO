  * Lurker should use a std::set rather than std::list [Easy] (Just
    make sure you test this. The hash should be based on just the
    thread, not every element. [Easy+]

  * Record download statistics from curl (Time, Bytes), populate back
    to UI [Medium] [Mostly done]

  * Redirect std::cout and std::cerr to an optional popup message log
    [Hard] (There's actually a Glib API for this in g_log)

  * Overlay some lurker info text on the image [Medium]
  ** Or some sort of visual lurker feedback. I dunno. [Hard]
  *** Well, there's some std::cout things now. [Partly done]

  * set_sensitivity(false) on the spinner when lurk-to-404 [Easy]

  * Make sure that we ignore everything after # after the last / in
    the thread url [Easy]

  * Make a utility function to implement getBoard(), getThread(). Have
    Request use that, and then application can use the utility
    functions directly in update_thread_dir_completer [Easy]

  * Save the thread html to the target directory and re-write image links
    to the file we save to. [Hard+]

  * Oh god, what happens if the thread name box is empty? [Easy]

  * The thread filename completer got wonky on me once. What's the
    deal? Dunno. Maybe the async method never finished or something.
  ** It seems like if you use a FileChooser in a different GTK
     program, the chosen file is silently propigated to
     Coldwind.
